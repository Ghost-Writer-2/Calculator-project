# 👀 Project Overview 
   This is just a normal Calculator game made by an amatuer for practice purposes. In this project I applied everything I have learned so far which are just beginner concepts of JavaScript. I know there are better ways to approach this project and I will continue updating the project as I learn more advanced concepts. I am also willing to learn from whatever advices and obdervations you may have for me regarding this project and my learning.

## 🕹️ Technologies Used 
  * HTML5
  * CSS3
  * JavaScript (Vanilla Js)

## 🔢 My Approach
  - When a button (that contains a number or simple arithmetic operator) is clicked the expression is collected and stored in the ``expression`` variable 
  - This variable is then evaluated when the equal button is pressed.
  - When the backspace button is clicked, the ``replace()`` replaces the last character in the ``expression`` variable with an empty string.
  - If the eval button is clicked, ``expression`` becomes equal to ``result``
  - Visual feedback is given (result is displayed)


## 📒 Techniques Applied 
  In this project I attempted to create a Calculator game with vanilla js as a learning project using the following concepts
  - I the ``||`` operator shorthand in place of an if statement
  - I used the ``eval()`` to evaluate expressions.
  - I used eventlisteners to run functions.
  - I used the replace() to create a backspace button.

## 🌩️ Problems Encountered
  The drawback I am currently facing is adding a keydown event handler to the body to that will run the backspace function (``del()``). 
  I will look for methods to solve this now

## 🐣 Areas to Improve 
  - Add more functionalities like a memory to store past calculations, double display i.e display both expression and answer simultaneously on the screen.

## 🌱 My Appeal for Tips and Advices 
  I would really appreciate every tip offered on how to solve the problems I'm facing in the project. I will also appreciate tips on how I can write a more maintainable and clean code.
